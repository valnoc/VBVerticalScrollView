VBAutolayout
===========

There are developers (like me) who prefer to create UI programmatically due to numerous reasons. I use storyboards for segues and user scene-path. But UIViewControllers are left empty. And I do not use xibs.

When you create adaptive UI programmatically the view (or viewcontroller) code becomes unreadable because of big autolayout creation calls.

VBAutolayout is a library which makes programmatic autolayout creation comfortable, readable and code-minimized.

## How to install
Use CocoaPods

    pod 'VBAutolayout'

or

Drag VBAutolayout dir into your project.

You can import "VBAutolayout.h" into precompiled header.
